# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
This program simulates Conway's Game of Life. Click on the screen to bring a cell to life or kill it. Press space to pause or unpause the simulation.

If you're unfamiliar with the rules of Conway's Game of Life, I've stolen this description from Wikipedia:
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Live cells are represented by white pixels, dead cells are represented by black pixels.
